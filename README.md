# Conway's Game of Life
Implementing [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in various languages.

## Rules
- Arrange a square grid
- Each cell interacts with its neighbours, which are cells that are vertically, horizontally or diagonally adjacent
- Any live cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell
- Any other live cell dies. Similarly, all dead cells remain dead.
